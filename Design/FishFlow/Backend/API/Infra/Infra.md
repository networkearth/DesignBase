**Note: Infrastructure implementation is deferred for later. This document will be completed when infrastructure deployment is prioritized.**

The infrastructure will include:
- Docker configuration for containerization
- CloudFormation templates for AWS resources (ECS, ALB, Route53)
- IAM roles and policies for S3 access
- ECS task definitions and service configurations
- ALB target groups and health check configuration
- Route53 DNS records for production domains
