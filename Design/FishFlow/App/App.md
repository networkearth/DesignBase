## `FishFlow App!`

### Interfaces

```
npm run
```

### Use Cases

A `React` app that displays `FishFlow` reports.

### Build

Just your standard `React` app that indexes at `App.js` in `src`

For now there's not much to it as we're in development.

#### Dependencies

- `App.js`

## `App.js`

For now, as we're just in development this is super simple. We will just load a dev scenario straight into `../DepthOccupancyReport.md:DepthOccupancyReport` and display nothing but that component. 

### Build

#### Placement

```
fishflow
|
+-- frontend
|   |
|   +-- src
|   |   |
|   |   +-- App.js <--
```
