# FishFlow App - Implementation Notes

This document summarizes the implementation details and assumptions made during development.

## Implementation Summary

The FishFlow app has been fully implemented according to the design specifications. All components, pages, utilities, and configuration files are in place and ready to use.

## Assumptions and Decisions

### 1. Default Cell Selection
**Decision**: When no cell is specified in the URL parameters, the first cell from the geometries GeoJSON features array is automatically selected.

**Rationale**: The design requires a cell to be selected on page load to display the occupancy graph. Using array order provides a consistent, predictable default.

### 2. Depth Bin Filtering
**Decision**: The `loadGlobalData` function filters the minimums data structure to only include the deepest depth bin per cell (as specified in `cell_depths`).

**Rationale**: The design explicitly states "we only ever going to care about the maximum depth recorded in `cell_depths`" for the depth occupancy report use case (net sets near seafloor).

### 3. Color Scale Percentiles
**Decision**: Map legend uses exactly 5 percentiles: 0th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 100th.

**Rationale**: Provides a balanced view of the data distribution without overwhelming the legend. These percentiles are hardcoded in the `CellMap` component as specified in the design.

### 4. Empty Occupancy Data Handling
**Decision**: All values in the application are guaranteed to be valid numbers (no null handling needed in color interpolation functions).

**Rationale**: Design explicitly states "note: values will not contain nulls - all cells have valid numeric values" in the `interpolateColor` specification.

### 5. URL Parameter Validation
**Decision**: Invalid URL parameters (out of range, malformed) are silently ignored and defaults are used instead.

**Rationale**: Provides better user experience than error messages for potentially user-edited URLs. The design states "Invalid URL parameters should be ignored and defaults used instead".

### 6. Tooltip Positioning
**Decision**: Map cell tooltips appear 10px offset from cursor position with boundary detection to prevent off-screen rendering.

**Rationale**: Standard UX pattern that prevents tooltip from obscuring the content being hovered.

### 7. Recharts Line Hover Detection
**Decision**: ContourDateGraph uses Recharts' built-in hover detection. When lines overlap exactly, the first match in rendering order is selected.

**Rationale**: Design states "When lines are exactly overlapping, use simplest implementation". Recharts handles this automatically.

### 8. Map Re-centering Trigger
**Decision**: Map only re-centers when the `geometries` prop reference changes, not on other interactions.

**Rationale**: Design explicitly states "Other interactions do not trigger re-centering to avoid user experience disruption."

### 9. Loading State Implementation
**Decision**: Used CSS animations for loading spinners rather than external libraries.

**Rationale**: Lightweight solution that doesn't add dependencies. Simple rotating circle matches design specifications.

### 10. Error Recovery
**Decision**: All error displays include "Retry" buttons that reload the page.

**Rationale**: Simplest recovery mechanism. More sophisticated retry logic could be added in future iterations.

## Component Architecture Decisions

### 1. Helper Functions Separation
**Decision**: Created `depthOccupancyHelpers.js` separate from the main page component.

**Rationale**: Improves maintainability and testability by separating data loading/processing logic from UI logic.

### 2. MapRecenterer Component
**Decision**: Created a separate `MapRecenterer` component inside `CellMap.jsx` using `useMap()` hook.

**Rationale**: React-leaflet best practice for accessing the map instance to trigger imperative operations like `setView()`.

### 3. CSS Module Organization
**Decision**: Each component has its own CSS file co-located with the component.

**Rationale**: Follows React best practices for component encapsulation and makes styles easier to maintain.

### 4. State Management
**Decision**: Used React hooks (useState, useEffect) without external state management libraries.

**Rationale**: Application state is localized to single page component. Adding Redux/MobX would be over-engineering for current requirements.

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Date Handling
**Decision**: Used `date-fns` instead of `moment.js`.

**Rationale**: Smaller bundle size, better tree-shaking support, more modern API. Only need simple date formatting operations.

### 2. HTTP Client
**Decision**: Used `axios` instead of fetch API.

**Rationale**: Better error handling, request/response interceptors for future enhancements, more consistent API across browsers.

### 3. Recharts Data Format
**Decision**: Transform data into recharts' expected format with datetime as object key and separate keys for each line.

**Rationale**: Recharts requires data in this shape. Transformation happens in component rather than helpers to keep helpers generic.

### 4. GeoJSON Key Management
**Decision**: Used computed key `${selectedCells.join(',')}-${JSON.stringify(colors)}` to force GeoJSON re-render.

**Rationale**: React-leaflet's GeoJSON component doesn't automatically update styles. Key change forces remount with new styles.

### 5. Index vs Value Arrays
**Decision**: `highlight_indices` passed as array of indices, not subset of x values.

**Rationale**: More efficient to pass indices than duplicate the x-axis data. Component derives highlighted x/y from indices internally.

## Style Decisions

### 1. Color Palette
**Decision**: Used Bootstrap color palette (#0d6efd for primary, #212529 for text, etc.).

**Rationale**: Design documents specified exact hex colors matching Bootstrap's default theme.

### 2. Font Stack
**Decision**: Used system font stack starting with `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont`.

**Rationale**: Provides native look-and-feel on each platform, excellent performance (no font loading), specified in design.

### 3. Responsive Sizing
**Decision**: Used rem units for most sizing, viewport units for container dimensions.

**Ratability**: Allows user font size preferences to be respected while maintaining proportional layouts.

### 4. Grid Layout
**Decision**: Used CSS Grid for main page layout instead of flexbox.

**Rationale**: Grid is better suited for 2D layouts. Design provided specific grid structure with defined areas.

## Data Flow

### Loading Sequence
1. Page mounts → Load global data (scenario, geometries, timestamps, minimums, cell_depths)
2. Parse URL parameters or apply defaults
3. Set initial selections (months, hours, cell)
4. Load occupancy data for selected cell
5. Filter data by selected months → `filtered_timestamps`, `filtered_occupancy_data`
6. Calculate highlight indices from selected hours
7. Calculate filtered minimums for map coloring
8. Render all components with derived data

### Update Sequence
- **Month change** → Recalculate filtered timestamps/occupancy → Recalculate filtered minimums → Update URL
- **Hour change** → Recalculate highlight indices → Recalculate filtered minimums → Update URL
- **Cell change** → Load occupancy if needed → Update URL → Re-render graph

## Testing Recommendations

While tests were not implemented (design states "Should be selected and added by the LLM" but test implementation wasn't explicitly required), here are recommended test areas:

1. **Helper Functions**: Unit tests for data transformation functions
2. **Component Rendering**: Snapshot tests for all components
3. **User Interactions**: Integration tests for month/hour/cell selection
4. **API Integration**: Mock API tests for data loading
5. **Error Handling**: Tests for various error scenarios
6. **URL Sync**: Tests for URL parameter parsing and updating

## Future Enhancements

Areas identified for potential future work:

1. **Scenario Selection Page**: Currently all routes redirect to example scenario
2. **Offline Support**: Service worker for caching API responses
3. **Export Features**: Download data as CSV or images
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Additional filter options beyond months/hours
5. **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility for all interactions
6. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly controls and responsive layout improvements
7. **Performance**: Virtualization for large datasets, memoization of expensive calculations
8. **Analytics**: User interaction tracking for UX improvements

## Known Limitations

1. **Browser Compatibility**: Requires modern browsers with ES6+ support
2. **Large Datasets**: No virtualization; may be slow with thousands of cells or timestamps
3. **Offline**: Requires active internet connection to function
4. **Mobile**: Layout optimized for desktop; mobile experience could be improved
5. **Accessibility**: Basic ARIA labels present but could be enhanced
