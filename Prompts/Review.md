# Design Document Review

## Objective
Review the provided design files and their dependencies to ensure they contain sufficient detail for autonomous implementation by an LLM agent with no prior context.

## Your Tasks

### 1. Comprehension Check
- Read all indicated design files thoroughly
- Follow and review any referenced dependencies or context documents
- Identify the complete scope of what needs to be built

### 2. Clarity Analysis
Evaluate each design file for:
- **Ambiguities**: Flag any vague requirements, unclear specifications, or undefined terms
- **Missing information**: Identify gaps in technical details, architecture decisions, or implementation specifics
- **Errors**: Contradictions in the given design or likely technical mistakes given the context
- **Assumptions**: Point out any implicit assumptions that should be made explicit
- **Dependencies**: Note if external dependencies are insufficiently documented

### 3. Implementation Readiness
Assess whether the designs include:
- Clear technical specifications and data structures
- API contracts, interfaces, or protocols
- Error handling and edge case requirements
- Testing criteria or acceptance conditions
- File/folder structure expectations
- Configuration requirements
- Any necessary environmental setup

### 4. Questions & Clarifications
Create a structured list of:
- **Critical blockers**: Issues that prevent implementation from starting
- **Uncertainties**: Areas needing clarification for correct implementation
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions to improve design completeness

## Success Criteria
The design should be comprehensive enough that any competent LLM agent could build the system from scratch with no additional context or clarifying questions.

## Output Format
Provide:
1. Summary of what will be built (in your own words)
2. List of critical issues requiring resolution (if any)
3. List of questions/uncertainties
4. Suggestions for improving design completeness
5. Confirmation of readiness (Yes/No + brief reasoning)
